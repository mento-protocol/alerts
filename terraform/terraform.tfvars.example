# Note: Tenderly integration code has been archived in terraform/tenderly-alerts-archived/
# due to pricing concerns. The code is fully functional and can be re-enabled if needed.
# We now use QuickNode Webhooks for blockchain event monitoring.

# Option 1: Use default multisigs (Mento Labs and Reserve)
# The default configuration in variables.tf includes both multisigs

# Option 2: Override with your own multisigs
# multisigs = {
#   "mento-labs" = {
#     name    = "Mento Labs Multisig"
#     address = "0x655133d8E90F8190ed5c1F0f3710F602800C0150"
#   }
#   "reserve" = {
#     name    = "Reserve Multisig"
#     address = "0x87647780180B8f55980C7D3fFeFe08a9B29e9aE1"
#   }
#   # Add more multisigs as needed:
#   # "treasury" = {
#   #   name    = "Treasury Multisig"
#   #   address = "0xYourTreasuryAddress..."
#   # }
